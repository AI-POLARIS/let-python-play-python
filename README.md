## What is this?

This is a simple game made with python and pygame. We made it possible to automate the game by impleminting some machine learning algorithms. It plays the game by itself and learns from its mistakes.

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the `agent.py` file by `python agent.py`
4. Enjoy the game

You can use the `requirements.txt` file to install the requirements.
Run the following command to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or you can install the requirements manually.
